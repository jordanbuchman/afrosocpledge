What's powering iendorsebernie.com

The website that is generated here is entirely client-side. It's just a static web page.

Source is in pug, so that means that index.php is generated from index.php.pug.

If you are deploying a branch of this, you may find yourself needing to set up a license to Adobe fonts to use the Jubilat web-font.
